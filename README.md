# TipTimeApp

This application was made as part of google's kotlin course.

TipTimeApp is an app that lets you calculate the tip for a given bill.
First the user needs to type the amount of money.
Then he needs to select the percentages of tip according to the quality of the service (20 percent is the default).
By default the result is rounded up, but the user can cancel the round up by toggling the switch abouve the "CALCULATE" button.
By pressing the "CALCULATE" button the application will display the amount of tip for a given bill.

In this application I performed:
1. Layout file editing
2. Adding strings and colors to resource values file
3. Configuring customized themes for day and dark
4. Implementing MDC (Material Design Component) design
5. Changing icon
6. Using Kotling OOP programming for app's logic
7. Executing instrumentation tests
